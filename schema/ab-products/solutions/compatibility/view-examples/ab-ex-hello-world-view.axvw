 Hello World Axvw

This file illustrates the minimal information you need for a view.

The first XML version line identifies an ARCHIBUS .axvw as an XML file.

The afmXmlView tags enclose the contents of the view.  A view is most
often a view of data, but you will find that the entire ARCHIBUS
interface is made of views: the main command area, the Solution
Explorer, the Process Navigator, the dashboards - even the Login
form - are all views.

This view is didactic: typically you would have more that a title in a view.
But you will see that many workflow views are simple view files like
this one but with just a few controls or action buttons attached.
