Containing view that itself loads two views:
o the flxbl tree in the left frame, and
o the rooms view in the right frame.

<!-- Target the containing view to the left or treeFrame -->

   <!-- Specify that the view should use the tree-details frameset -->

   <fileCategory extension="frms" fileName="tree-details.frms"/>

   <title translatable="false">Floors by Building Drill-down Tree</title>

   <!-- Target the rooms view to the details frame.

   Since the rooms view is contained in the flxbl view, the default
   action of selecting a record in the flxbl tree will be to
   restrict the rooms view to just those rooms on that selected floor. -->
