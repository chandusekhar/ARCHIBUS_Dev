The ab-ex-response.* files are examples for illustrating xslt files
and xpath statements used for transforming the XML output from
ARCHIBUS/FM Web Central.

o ab-ex-response.htm is the HTML file that calls the XSLT transformation
  using javascript.  [This example uses the XSLT transformation in the
  Internet Explorer browser rather than the server-side component
  used by FM Web Central, so there may be small differences
  between the statements supported.]

o ab-ex-response.xsl is the .xsl file holding the transformation
  and formatting used to product the HTML output displayed
  in the browser.

o ab-ex-response.xml is the response-for-xsl output given to the
  object logger for the "Room Restrictions and Statistics" view
  example.  The user was "AFM" logged in to the sample project.

  The only changes to the output were
  (a) to rename the .xml file;
  (b) to run it through the tidy pretty-printer using this command line:
      tidy.exe -i -m -xml -utf8 -wrap 0 --indent-attributes 1 response.xml
