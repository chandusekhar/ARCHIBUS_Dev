<!-- Each tab page displays a separate child view in an IFRAME.
     Child views loaded into IFRAMEs are isolated from each other and from the parent view.
     This means there will be no conflicts between variable and function names between child views,
     but it also means that the child views cannot easily exchange data or call functions from each other. -->
