        <p style="font-size:11px">* Work Packages receive a check mark when they are Completed, Closed or 100% Invoiced.
        <br/>** The Work Package % Complete is calculated by dividing the value of Completed Actions by the total value of the Work Package, as estimated by Design Cost.  The value of a partially-completed action is determined by multiplying the action's % Complete value by its Design Cost.
        <br/>*** The Work Packages are sorted by WBS Code.</p>
